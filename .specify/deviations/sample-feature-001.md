## Spec Says

> "All template sections are filled with example content"

The specification requires all sections to contain realistic example content.

---

## Implementation Does

Some sections like "API Contracts" and "Data Model" contain "N/A" markers
instead of detailed examples, because this sample represents a documentation-only
feature that has no API or data model.

---

## Rationale

For a documentation-only sample feature:
- Including fake API contracts would be misleading
- Showing "N/A" demonstrates how to handle inapplicable sections
- This teaches users that not all sections apply to all features

---

## Impact

- Users learn that "N/A" is acceptable for inapplicable sections
- No negative impact on sample quality
- Actually improves educational value

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Include fake API contracts** - Rejected because it would teach bad habits
   (inventing unnecessary specifications)

2. **Remove the sections entirely** - Rejected because showing the sections
   with N/A demonstrates complete template coverage

---

## Review Plan

- [ ] Review by: Not applicable (permanent educational example)
- [ ] Conditions for removing deviation: None (intentional design choice)

---

## Approval

- Approved by: claude-learns maintainers
